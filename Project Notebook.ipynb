Each function serves a unique purpose in the bot. It uses a variety of while loops to retain correct user input and offers a quit function to exit the bot.\n",

    "I feel that my project goes above and beyond the minimal project requirements. With this class being my first time ever coding, I wanted to learn a lot about what I could do with python. Two things that I wanted to go in depth on were nested functions and while loops. Upon research and discussion with my friends, I felt that I could incorporate both unique elements to my project. Nested functions are interesting to me because they utilized a function within another function (I thought it was super interesting because it seemed similar to Class structure but also different at the same time). I added one of these in my main function along with a while loop to access values in a variety of dictionaries. In addition, I utilized while loops to verify specific string values. If the string value was not recognized, it would ask for a valid value to continue the function of the bot. I think that this was a valuable piece of information because my bot was able to only take into account specific strings and reject any other types while still prompting for a correct string value. I felt that while loops were super interesting to learn because they would continue forever until a specific value/instance was met, and with my bot, I only wanted specific strings."
